varnish_test
====================
This test cookbook uses [WireMock](http://wiremock.org/) to serve live, individually-constructed HTTP requests
through our HTTP cache.

In contrast to [`varnishtest`](https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/trunk/reference/varnishtest.html) which uses a
special internal, undocumented scripting language to test Varnish configuration internals,
these tests are designed to strictly test the HTTP-layer inputs/outputs generated by the cache.
This should make this test suite interoperable with any future HTTP cache we may integrate in the future.
