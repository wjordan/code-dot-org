%p
  There are currently unsolved issues with renaming stages
  (see #<a href="https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/76999866">76999866</a> #<a href="https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/82514628">82514628</a>).
  For now, ask an engineer - refer them to

  By default, scripts are hidden from teachers in the teacher dashboard. To make a script visible to teachers, add a line
  %code hidden 'false'
  to the top of the script. It will show up in the teacher dashboard once it hits staging (or the next time levelbuilder gets rebuilt).
